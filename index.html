        The court will now start its proceedings, announced the judge-witch, along with a goblin investigator of the crime. “The culprit shall now give his alibi,” yelled the dwarf. A supple black cat cleared its throat and started to enunciate his carefully crafted alibi. “My witch had left a few minutes ago, assigning me a task to finish her spell while she was away. Of course, I was not that motivated, so I took the opportunity to sniff the tuna cans my witchie dear had bought for another spell. I jumped towards the cabinets, and pushed the cans with my paws. Out fell a bottle of sparkly stuff, which motivated me to work.” “Objection!” yelled the pixie plaintiff. “How did it even motivate you?” “Dear pixie, I decided that I would get to see more of these shimmering concoctions while working on the spell. I brought turtle shells and lizard tails, antelope antlers and possum paws, everything that was on the ingredient checklist. While I was bringing a bottle called Dancing Night-pixies of Arlando, otherwise known as DNA, with great care, I spotted a mouse. You will be empathetic enough to understand my weakness of mice. With a lot of ebullience, I ran towards the small rascal scurrying about, when I dropped the DNA into the cauldron. That was when it happened! Puffy clouds started to appear and vanish, and I hid behind the chair while the ruckus was going on. Out popped a strange creature, which we now call humans, the most destructive mammals on earth. So, I cannot be blamed for whatever is happening right now to planet earth.” “Well,” said the pixie, “We can all agree to the fact that you’re still bad luck, for you are capable of unconsciously bringing a species like humans!” The defendant groaned, and admitted that the pixie plaintiff had indeed won the case.

        Lady Lemenia was anxious about her next trip to Oxford. She had made it a habit to do an excessive research project on the crime rates of the place she was going to visit next. She had become rather dotty carrying lots of cash around. She was never hesitant in showing it to her friends or pen pals, anyone but to thieves. She stepped into the tube as the usual mind the gap announcement blared through the speakers. A fine besuited gentleman walked into the carriage as well. It was nearly twenty-five minutes when he noticed this well-groomed lady. He immediately understood it was Lady Lemenia, noticing her perturbed look and several purses. He cleared his throat and spoke, “I do not wish to say this just because Lady Lemenia is present in this coach, but to all the unfamiliar faces I see. The route you are taking to Oxford Street is plagued with light-fingered pickpockets. You must be on your guard.” Worried looks took over the passengers’ faces as they started checking their wallets and bags. Lady Lemenia’s state was the worst. She started to look all over the place. He calmed them down by saying, “Everyone, take it easy, for goodness sake! I am quite familiar with these thefts, I’ve gotten two or three snatched right under my nose!” A young chap questioned him, “So, why should we trust you, if you can get yours easily snatched?” He answered, while maintaining his cool. “Those were dummy wallets! I am aware of these scoundrels.” There was a heavy sigh of relief and the anxiety eased. He took a round of the coach, and a few minutes later, his stop arrived. “Cheerio, everyone! I kept a watch, and not even a dime was spared by me and my eyes!” There was a long thankful goodbye as he stepped outside, with three dozen wallets in his sticky fingers. “Not a dime was spared by me, as promised!”

    <h1 class="title">If Dogs Ruled the World</h1>
    <div class="line"></div>
    <p class="text">
        It would be a delicious irony if the rulership of the world was passed into the hands of animals. Years of inspiring speeches from animal activists would finally be of use for us. But, if it was ever handed over to the dogs, they would follow a twisted trajectory in this responsibility. As a side note, it would be a proof to many universities’ research and praise about the mind of the dog , for their scheme of governance is cleverly planned.
        The dogs would decide to maintain their standard, their pure-hearted treatment towards the unappreciative humans. Treat them with even more respect, fondness and devotion.
        If this decision was ever taken in an ongoing pupper conference, there would be many objections.
        I can picture a Beagle with the protest of treating an adversary with kindness and not being vengeful. They were not worthy of any respect. This has the most interesting answer.
        These domesticated Canidae had planned to plague humankind with ever-lasting guilt, anguish and compunction. “It’s always better to get your work done in a good natured way than an ill-mannered one.”
        Hence, maintaining their soft-hearted reputation, they would get back their long awaited revenge. It was even planned to get the other animals to join in, all the existing fauna mankind has ever wronged.
        Hopefully, our eyes will be opened before democracy takes a twisted turn.

    <h1 class="title">A lame dog</h1>
    <div class="line"></div>
    <p class="text">

        The cat sipped its milk, and started to narrate the tale to her grandchildren in her weary voice. “There was a lame dog, walking in the misty and dull streets. She had gotten into a fight with another dog, to get meat for her wailing puppies at home. Alas, she was unsuccessful and limped all the way home, with a tired mind and guilty soul.” Her granddaughter kitten interrupted, “I don’t have any pity for her. She was a dog, after all.” The grandmother continued, “Child, there is no need for insensitivity, even to one’s declared enemies. What quarrel do we have with the dogs? It’s the humans who crafted this lie. Now, back to the story. With a heavy heart, this dog continued, when she came across an ill cat. It was shivering from head to paw, with a fevered brain and drooping whiskers. She also noticed a kitty name tag broken beside her. It was evident of what had happened. “Cat,” she remarked, “I never had thought of this day where I would relate to the feelings of a feline foe, but now, it has. I feel what you feel, something called eemh-ph-athy, named by humans for humans when it was meant for animals. The world seems sour and eccentric, when you start to question every single occurrence. It is just a point of view, my cat, just a point of view.” The cat lifted his furry head and replied with a smile, “Your smile sparks just a bit of positivity, but your eyes say that something worse has happened to you. Yet, you still have that little bit of sympathy to bring someone else happiness. I appreciate that. Would you be offended if I asked you what exactly had happened?” “I have new born pups, you see, with no food in their little innocent tummies.” The cat replied, “I know a place where we can get some chicken. Come, dog, let’s trudge to the market.” And so, the cat and the dog made their way, paw in paw, in a world full of happiness.” The cat sighed, with a blissful smile, waving at the dog.

    <h1 class="title">A Genie-ous Wish (Well, kind of)</h1>
    <div class="line"></div>

        Most genie lamps are found in sandy and sweltering deserts, but this golden one was tucked away under some leaves of a rainforest. It was an ordinary stroll when I stumbled along this vessel, with no labels or tags that said, “Rub me”. This was because the tale of genies and lamps was quite popular in our town. I rubbed it vigorously when an expected misty blue cloud rose from the lamp. It was a big, blue genie, but this one was a lady. She nonchalantly used her nail filer, as she rubbed it on her nails and said, “Child, my husband is doing the dishes and dusting of the house, thanks to the quarantine, and I can now replace him on his part-time job. Name your wishes, child!”
        I curtsied, and spoke. “First things first, genie. I want to make it clear that I am not a problematic possessor of this lamp, just a little skeptical. I heard that you give three wishes, but each one of them drowns you and the world into chaos! And from one way or the other, you get this other genie lamp that fixes what the other genie started. Thirdly, you can allow us to wish ANYTHING but a few more wishes ” The lady-genie was aghast. She finally said, “Innocent minds of children! Stuffed with these lies! Child, you have been misled by your joking adults of the town. Firstly, you do not get three wishes, for that is my unlucky number informed by my fortune teller. Secondly, it is just that we are literal minded that makes this chaos, for you certainly do not expect me to have a vast vocabulary. And lastly -” I interrupted her, “Yes, I understand that. But I had already made this goal in life, that I would surprise you by how satisfied I am. The lady asked, “Is there nothing you desire?” I replied, “Well, there is one thing though. I wish to know the reincarnated form of my past life!” The genie huffed, “Add that to the list of the things that we cannot do!” And the lamp disappeared. I sighed to myself, “I wasn’t a genie, that’s for sure!”

        Mother breathed a sigh of relief after setting the dinnerware (rather ostentatiously)
        . Father and I smiled to know that her perfectionist side was content. There was suddenly a sizzling sound when the lights went off. “Be careful,” Father warned us,”Liam tends to be a prankster when he visits us.”
        We crept to the backdoor from where we could hear a creaking noise and hid behind the couch to see if it was Liam. It was a person, tip-toeing towards the living-room. As he turned to cautiously shut the door with care that it did not make a sound, Father walked quietly and held his back. “Got you!” he cried. “You got me! Please, spare me! It was harmless” Liam shrieked. We couldn’t see him, but would’ve loved to know his expression when he realised his prank was foiled.“Still into theatre?” Mother smiled and said. I put a garland around his neck and led him to the dining room. The sorbet and greek salad first caught his attention, and he rushed towards the table and started to tuck in. We laughed at this usual impractical joke. Our merry chat paused when the lights came back on along with the TV. We heard the bell ring, which was ringing for quite some time. Father answered the door, and we were aghast. It was Liam! The sound of the television reporter still rings in my ears,”Recently guilty bank robber has escaped prison and is still on the loose.” It was a sight to see him with the lettuce leaves and the tails of the sprouts hanging out of his mouth, with him surprised and us too.
